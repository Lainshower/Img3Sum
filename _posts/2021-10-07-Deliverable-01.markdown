`The first task` was given in the open source course. First of all, we thought about what kind of project to carry out. And, `AI` has become the most hot topic these days. So, I decided to make something related to it.

After extracting text from the image, we planned a project to create a three-line summary with extracted sentences, and also a three-line summary translated into Korean. Therefore, our team name was decided as `Img3Sum` based on the three-line summary for the purpose of project creation.

A new `GitHub repository` for the `Img3Sum` project was created.

And, they shared their roles. 

First, `SON` is in charge of building a backend using flask and building a frontend. 

In addition, `OH` plays a role in finding a program that extracts images into text.

In addition, `JANG` plays a role in summarizing the text extracted from the image by 3 lines, translating it into Korean, and then creating a model that proceeds with a 3 line summary. 

Finally, `YOON` was responsible for importing the `Papago API`.
