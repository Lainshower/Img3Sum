<p>After extracting text from the image, we planned a project to create a three-line summary with extracted sentences, and also a three-line summary translated into Korean. Therefore, our team name was decided as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Img3Sum</code> based on the three-line summary for the purpose of project creation.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub repository</code> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Img3Sum</code> project was created.</p>

<p>And, they shared their roles.</p>

<p>First, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SON</code> is in charge of building a backend using flask and building a frontend.</p>

<p>In addition, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OH</code> plays a role in finding a program that extracts images into text.</p>

<p>In addition, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JANG</code> plays a role in summarizing the text extracted from the image by 3 lines, translating it into Korean, and then creating a model that proceeds with a 3 line summary.</p>

<p>Finally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOON</code> was responsible for importing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Papago API</code>.</p>
