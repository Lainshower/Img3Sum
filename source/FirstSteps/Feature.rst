In this tutorial you will *create* a documentation project on Read the Docs by importing an Sphinx project from a GitHub repository, tailor its configuration, and explore several useful features of the platform.

The tutorial is aimed at **people interested** in learning how to use Read the Docs to host their documentation projects. You will fork a fictional software library similar to the one developed in the official Sphinx tutorial. No prior experience with Sphinx is required, and you can follow this tutorial without having done the Sphinx one.

The only things you will need to ''follow'' are a web browser, an Internet connection, and a GitHub account (you can register for a free account if you don’t have one). You will use Read the Docs Community, which means that the project will be public.

Getting started
***************
To start, sign in to GitHub and navigate to the tutorial GitHub template, where you will see a green Use this template button. Click it to open a new page that will ask you for some details:

Leave the default ``Owner``, or change it to something better for a tutorial project.

Introduce an appropriate “Repository name”, for example rtd-tutorial.

Make sure the project is “Public”, rather than “Private”.

After that, click on the green Create repository from template button, which will generate a new repository on your personal account (or the one of your choosing). This is the repository you will import on Read the Docs, and it contains the following files:
